## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`

In order to run the application in an Android simulator, ensure that all dependencies have been installed. In the command line enter the following commands: `npm run prod` in order to create the build folder required to create the application as well as start the server on localhost:5000. Next, `ionic capacitor add android` to create the android files needed for the android application. Enter `npx cap open android` to open the android file within the simulator, or open the newly created android folder in Android Studio. The application will require a build in Android Studio prior to running the application on the simulator.

Alternatively, users can navigated to the [deployed link](https://cerafinn.github.io/weatherreact) on the simulator in order to view the application.

Note: As of this time, the android application build fails to execute due to issues with querying the files in the build folder.

## Usage

The application makes a call to the openweathermap API one-call after the user enters the City or zipcode they wish to search and the forecast is dynamically displayed below the search bar.
